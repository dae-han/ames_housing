    "[Zillow](https://www.zillow.com), a real estate database company offers what they call 'Zestimate'. According to Zillow, Zestimate is an estimate on property value from their 'public and user submitted data taking into account home facts, location and market conditions'. How can we make predictions like Zestimate? What can we do to improve the predictions?        \n",
